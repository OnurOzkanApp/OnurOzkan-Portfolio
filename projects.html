              <div class="details-content" hidden>
                <p>Timeline Raider is a fast, forward-scrolling shooter where the world moves toward the player.
                I built Timeline Raider in Unity (C#) with an optimized, flexible architecture that is intentionally
                future-proof. Each system is designed to be easily extended, edited, and maintained, so new mechanics,
                content, or UI can be added with minimal refactoring.To keep performance tight—especially on 
                mobile—I rely on low-poly assets and an extensive Object Pooling strategy. Bullets, enemies, 
                allies, VFX, and other gameplay objects are reused rather than reallocated, reducing memory 
                pressure and GC spikes while keeping frame times stable.
                </p>
                <p>The game is structured around eras: 
                Stone Age, Medieval, Industrial, World War II, Modern Day, Future, and Cyberpunk. Every era 
                brings distinct environments, character outfits, weapons, enemies, and comrades. Enemy health 
                and weapon characteristics evolve between eras to maintain challenge and a clear sense of progression.</p>
                <p>For content creation, I model and edit low-poly assets in Blender. Character rigs are standardized 
                with Mixamo so different models share a common skeleton, ensuring cross-compatible animation sets 
                and smoother integration of new characters.</p>
                <p>Weapons are driven by a ScriptableObject-based system, and the core game logic uses modular manager 
                patterns and targeted design patterns (such as Singleton where appropriate). This approach keeps 
                the codebase scalable and organized, making it straightforward to iterate on balance, add new weapons, 
                or introduce era-specific rules.

              <div class="details-content" hidden>
                <p>I built a robust, scalable project architecture in Unity (C#) with a modular codebase that makes it easy
                   to add new cube types and levels without heavy refactoring.</p>
                <p>The game systems include multiple cube colors, unique special cubes for each color, a powerful end-game 
                  White Cube, and obstacles (Prisms and Stones) with distinct interactions. Animations vary by cube type 
                  and by the number of cubes destroyed, there’s a custom Level Progress Bar, and music persists smoothly 
                  between gameplay and the main menu.</p>
                <p>For mobile performance, I implemented a custom Object Pooling system, used Singletons sparingly and 
                  only in manager components, and built a clean state flow for Win, Lose, and Pause screens.</p>
                <p>Content is organized as 50 hand-crafted levels defined in external JSON, which enables fast iteration. 
                  The game supports level lock/unlock and replay (completed levels are replayable, while locked ones 
                  remain hidden), and the Targets UI updates dynamically based on active goals.</p>
                <p>On the content side, I edited sprites and UI in Photopea, modeled Prism shards in Blender, and created 
                  VFX with Unity’s Particle System and Animator (using carefully selected free Asset Store and 
                  AI-generated assets). I produced the trailer with CapCut and OBS Studio.</p>

                In my capacity as a Scrum Master for the Android app "CliniQueue App," designed for a clinic setting, 
                I led a cross-functional team in the agile development process. The app featured distinct logins for 
                both patients and doctors, fostering a comprehensive healthcare experience. Patients were empowered to 
                explore and choose doctors, search for specific practitioners, and seamlessly book appointments. On the 
                doctor's side, the app provided a centralized platform for managing schedules and accessing patient information.

                I redesigned the CSCB63 course page using Python Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite. The goal was to modernize 
                the site’s architecture and presentation while keeping the stack lightweight and easy to maintain. I implemented separate 
                login flows and permissions for students and instructors. Instructors gained the ability to add and edit grades, while 
                students could securely view their own information and grades.</p>
                <p>
                The user interface was refreshed to be more modern, accessible, and easy to navigate—improving overall usability and 
                meeting basic accessibility expectations for contrast, structure, and keyboard friendliness.</p>

                  During the Summer of 2018, I was taking a second-year computer science course named Software Tools and 
                  Systems Programming which focuses on Unix and C programming. And for our second assignment, I was asked 
                  to build a program that uses a linked list structure and the program would be a basic version of a real 
                  program called "Buxfer." Buxfer is a business-related program that tracks the shared expenses of different 
                  groups. There are two possible types of groups, one is a business group and the other is a personal group. 
                  In this assignment, we had to work with multiple files. These files include a file with the starter code, 
                  a file that contains structs, a file with the main function and a makefile that compiles all files. Since 
                  it is developed in C, we were expected to manage the memory efficiently by using functions such as malloc 
                  and we were expected to handle all the errors to make sure that the program does not crash. As a result, 
                  I've completed all the necessary methods with error handling and comments that explain my code so that 
                  in a real-world situation my code would be understandable if anyone needs to use it in the future. 
                  As a result, I received an A+ with a grade of 97. This project allowed me to understand how to apply my 
                  knowledge from my previous experiences to a new situation. As I needed to use my knowledge of linked 
                  lists from previous classes to complete this project. It also helped me to put the new information that 
                  I had learned about C together to build a successful C program.

                <p>
                When I was in 12th grade, I wanted to work on a mathematics project on Java that could help other students 
                with calculus. Even though I had a lot of experience working as a group on class projects, I also wanted to 
                develop my teamwork skill by working with someone on a coding project. Since my objective was to learn more 
                about the work environment. And developing projects as a team. So, I decided to ask one of my classmates, 
                since she and I helped each other out with our separate final projects for a Java summer program that we 
                participated in. Then we decided to create an application called "Planet Math" that would have all the 
                information about different subjects in calculus such as integration, derivative and trigonometry. But we 
                also wanted to make sure that the program should not be boring and therefore, it should look more appealing to the students.</p>
                <p>
                Firstly, we wanted to follow a proper development cycle. Thus, we wanted to create a plan before coding anything. 
                So, we worked together to come up with a design and then what subjects to cover. We discussed our plans to our 
                mathematics teacher to get feedback. In the end, our program had a total of 20 subjects. 5 subjects in Math and 
                15 subjects in the Geometry section. Then, we started to create the pages for every subject by working together. 
                We also decided that we should work on separate topics within subjects then put them together. So, we started 
                to build the first version of our application. While we started coding, we went to our computer science teacher 
                and told her about our joint project. She loved the idea and she agreed to give some feedback. With her suggestions, 
                we changed the design a little before the first version was completed.</p>
                <p>After the initial build, we worked with our teacher during the breaks and after school hours to optimize the project. 
                Later on, she asked us about the idea of putting our project into lab computers or our school's online system 
                called "Moodle". She also wanted us to continue to expand the application and add new things to version 1.2 of 
                the Planet Math. During this project, my partner and I, we both learned so much about the importance of teamwork, 
                communication with your partner, planning  and getting feedback about the difficulties that you might encounter.</p>
